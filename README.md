### automatic

##### Source files typically containing variable values

Package manifest: [Nuspec](http://docs.nuget.org/Create/Nuspec-Reference) (nuspec)  
Install and uninstall scripts: [PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx) (ps1)

##### Source files typically __not__ containing variable values

GUI automation: [AutoHotKey](http://ahkscript.org/) (ahk) or [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/) (au3)

##### Automation process

1. scraping HTTP with regular expressions using [ketarin](https://ketarin.org/), then
2. populating a reserved layout to XML and powershell install/uninstall/setup scripts with [chocopkgupdater](https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolateypackageupdater) or other scripts, and finally
3. packing the generated source files into a zip file, saved as a [nupkg](http://docs.nuget.org/Create/Creating-and-Publishing-a-Symbol-Package)
4. pushing the nupkg file to chocolaty feed for moderation

Each sub-directory is equivalent to the application ID, otherwise known as the Application Name in Ketarin and stored in Ketarin's variable `{appname}`

See [ketarin\README.md](https://github.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/blob/master/ketarin/README.md) for more information about automatically updating packages from this repo.

### icons
Icons pointed to in the nuspec manifest file by XML tag `<iconUrl>`.  These URLs are shown as the package graphic on Chocolatey.org for the respective package.

e.g. the icon on `https://chocolatey.org/packages/gtk-runtime/2.24.10.20121010` is linked to `https://cdn.rawgit.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages/19d35dff574b7496b92f235fa1503d47b861871a/icons/gtk-runtime.svg` and is configured in `gtk-runtime.nuspec` by XML tag `<iconUrl>`  when `nuget.exe push gtk-runtime.1.2.3.nupkg -Source https://chocolatey.org/` (performed without user intervention by `chocolateypackageupdater`).

The URL that should be used should not point directly to the file.  Instead, use this service http://rawgit.com/

### licenses 
Limited use cases where the legal user agreements to terms of usage of the software for packages being installed is not available or not in reliably published way for Internet access.

If applicable, this location would be pointed to by `<licenseUrl>`.

However, most all packages point directly to the LICENSE or COPYING file if the source code is publicly available.  Otherwise, the `<licenseUrl>` points to the licensing terms as published on a publicly available web page.

### manual
Packages that must have their nuspec and powershell control scripts manually edited (text editor), packaged (cpack) and pushed (cpush).

Only packages that __never__ get updated should be here.

Note that while Nupkg files may contain any binary file, typically, they only contain essential wrapper information explaining where the install program is located and how to install the program.  However, since packages in this folder may no longer have an official published source, they may be more likely to contain the executable or install file(s) directly within the zipped nupkg file.
