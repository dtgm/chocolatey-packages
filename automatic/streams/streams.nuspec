    <description>
Reveal NTFS alternate streams. The NTFS file system provides applications the ability to create alternate data streams of information. By default, all data is stored in a file's main unnamed data stream, but by using the syntax 'file:stream', you are able to read and write to alternates. Not all applications are written to access alternate streams, but you can demonstrate streams very simply. First, change to a directory on a NTFS drive from within a command prompt. Next, type `  echo hello > test:stream  `

You've just created a stream named 'stream' that is associated with the file 'test'. Note that when you look at the size of test it is reported as 0, and the file looks empty when opened in any text editor. To see your stream enter `more &lt; test:stream` (the type command doesn't accept stream syntax so you have to use more).

#### Command line usage

__streams__ [__-s__] [__-d__] &lt;_file_ | _directory_&gt;

__-s__  Recurse subdirectories.

__-d__  Delete streams. Streams takes wildcards e.g. 'streams *.txt'.
