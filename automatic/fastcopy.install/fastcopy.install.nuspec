FastCopy is **the Fastest Copy/Delete Software on Windows**.

It supports UNICODE and over MAX_PATH (260 characters) file pathnames.

It automatically selects different methods depending on whether the source and destination directories are on the same or different drive.
* **Different drive:** Reading and writing are processed respectively in parallel by separate threads.
* **Same drive:**	Reading is processed until the buffer fills. When the buffer is filled, writing is started and processed in bulk.

Reading/Writing is processed with no OS cache so other applications do not become slow.

It can achieve reading/writing performance that is close to the device limit.

Include/Exclude filter (UNIX Wildcard style) can be specified. In ver3.0 or later, relative paths can be specified.

It runs fast and does not hog resources, because MFC is not used. (Designed using Win32 API and C Runtime only)

#### Notes

* This package will install the FastCopy shell extension.
* Install and uninstall of this package does have a few windows flash open and close.  I.E. This package is not silent, but it is no-touch.
* Upon uninstall, a `.dll` file remains locked by explorer and will not be deleted until a reboot.

#### Package parameters

* `/NoSubs` - The FastCopy Explorer shell extension choices will not appear in a submenu (as is the default) but rather on the main context menu.

This parameter can be requested on installation of the package like so:
  `choco install fastcopy.install -params '"/NoSubs"'`
