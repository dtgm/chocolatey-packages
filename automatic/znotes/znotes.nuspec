    <summary>Lightweight cross-platform application for notes managment with simple interface</summary>
    <description>
zNotes is a note management application. It has a user friendly, attractive interface and has vertical tabs that can be placed on any side of your text area. Use it to organize your daily tasks as well as future activities like meetings, interviews, appointments, shopping, phone calls and anything else that would normally prompt you to jot down a note.
When you first open zNotes you'll need to create a folder where it can store your notes, saving them as plain text. You can create notes using another application like KWord or OpenOffice and they'll show up in zNotes. You can turn on directory scanning or turn it off for new notes on startup, depending on what you prefer.

To make a new note you just click the green "plus" sign in the toolbar which makes a new tab that is numbered sequentially starting with "0" and moving up. Of course, you don't have to number your notes; you can change their name. Notes are kept in their original order at first but the next time you start up zNotes they'll be alphabetized.

As you type your notes zNotes will highlight links, although it doesn't have HTML editing. Just as in Word, you can hold down the CTRL key while clicking the link and it will open from inside zNotes.

The application also offers scripts and commands; you can script the commands you want and they will be in a drop-down menu. There are just two commands at first use, to print the contents and upload the text of a note to paste but you can add others if you wish.

zNotes has search capabilities, too. It's a great way to jot down quick notes such as a link you want to remember, phone numbers, an email address if you don't want to bother opening your word processor, web browser or email client.

Written in the C++ programming language using Qt framework. 

When I migrated from XFCE, I could not find a program simular to xfce4-Notes-plugin, so I created this program.

Has versions for GNU/Linux, Windows, OS/2.
