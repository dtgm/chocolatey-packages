SketchUp is a 3D modeling computer program for a wide range of drawing applications.

* Create 3D models of buildings, furniture, interiors, landscapes, and more.
* Customize the SketchUp interface to reflect the way you work.
* Share 3D models as walkthrough animations, scenes, or printouts, with realistic light and shadows. You can even print a model on a 3D printer.
* Import files from other 3D modeling programs or tools, or export your SketchUp file for use with other popular modeling and image-editing software.

#### Trial/Freeware (limited functionality)
This package loads the Sketchup Make installer which functions as follows:
* &lt;=30 days: Sketchup Make with all SketchUp Pro features on a trial basis
* &gt;30 days: On first run, user (admin) must make a choice:
 * Sketchup Pro features expire and software is locked-in as Sketchup Make -- a limited, non-commercial [freeware](http://help.sketchup.com/en/content/sketchup-make-and-sketchup-pro) version.
 * [Buy a Pro license](http://www.sketchup.com/buy/sketchup-pro). The additional features are locked-in, and it officially becomes Sketchup Pro. Any messaging that would identify the program as Sketchup Make is converted to Sketchup Pro. 
    
#### [Freeware Licensing Note](https://www.sketchup.com/license/c/sketchup)
SketchUp Make software is licensed only for non-commercial use for your internal business purposes. Non-commercial use means that **you may not sell, rent, lease or lend the output of the Software**. Any other use requires the purchase of a SketchUp Pro license.
