		<description>
The Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package installs runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries required to run applications developed with Visual C++ SP1 on a computer that does not have Visual C++ 2008 SP1 installed. 

This package installs runtime components of C Runtime (CRT), Standard C++, ATL, MFC, OpenMP and MSDIA libraries. For libraries that support side-by-side deployment model (CRT, SCL, ATL, MFC, OpenMP) they are installed into the native assembly cache, also called WinSxS folder, on versions of Windows operating system that support side-by-side assemblies.

This will install both the 32 and 64 bit versions on a 64 bit OS.  The 32 bit version will only be installed on a 32 bit OS.
