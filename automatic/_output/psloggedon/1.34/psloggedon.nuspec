Show users logged on to a system.

You can determine who is using resources on your local computer with the "net" command ("net session"), however, there is no built-in way to determine who is using the resources of a remote computer. In addition, NT comes with no tools to see who is logged onto a computer, either locally or remotely. PsLoggedOn is an applet that displays both the locally logged on users and users logged on via resources for either the local computer, or a remote one. If you specify a user name instead of a computer, PsLoggedOn searches the computers in the network neighborhood and tells you if the user is currently logged on.

#### Command line usage

__psloggedon__ [__-__] [__-l__] [__-x__] [\\\\computername | username]

__-__    Displays the supported options and the units of measurement used for output values.

__-l__    Shows only local logons instead of both local and network resource logons.

__-x__    Don't show logon times.

__\\\\computername__    Specifies the name of the computer for which to list logon information.

__username__    If you specify a user name _PsLoggedOn_ searches the network for computers to which that user is logged on. This is useful if you want to ensure that a particular user is not logged on when you are about to change their user profile configuration.
