    <summary>Executes processes in a protected, isolated space, otherwise known as a "sandbox"</summary>
    <description>
A process sandbox helps to manage and limit access permissions a process has to your data.  Use it to safely test new software for usability, safely study behavior of known spyware and malware, or browse the web from a sandboxed browser to completely shield your computer and network from Internet Bad Things.

### Features
* Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially.
* Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows.
* Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system.
* Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox.

### Shareware; Free with limitations for personal, non-commercial use
* After 30 days, nag screen appears that may be dismissed temporarily.
* Limited to one sandbox at a time.
* Only software explicitly requested may run in the sandbox (sandboxed programs must be started from Sandboxie program rather than optionally intercepted on the fly).
* For more information about licensing, see http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?RegisterSandboxie and the [licensing FAQ](http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?FAQ_Licensing).
