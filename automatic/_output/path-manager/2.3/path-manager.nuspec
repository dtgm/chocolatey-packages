    <releaseNotes>
First version (v1.0) was developed with Visual Studio 2012 Express (C#, .NET 4.5)
Second version (v2.0) is developed with Lazarus IDE v1.0.8 (Pascal)
That means, from version 2.0 Path Manager is a native windows application and it no longer needs .NET framework.

This change also resulted in increased size of executable however increase in performance and speed is significant. New executable of version 2.0 is compressed with upx.

#### Overview of changes (v2.3):
* Fixed problem of exception on startup
* Added function to notify all windows that the environment variables have changed

#### Overview of changes (v2.2):
* Removed shortcuts for refresh and about (were causing problem in Windows XP)
* Added Popup-Menu for variable-list and value-list
* Restart As Admin button now invisible when Path-Manager is run as admin
* It seemes that environment change message in not broadcast to applications, as for now, I am looking for some proper solution. For the meantime restarting explorer.exe should do the job.

#### Overview of changes (v2.1):
* Support for non-admin users
* Fixed splitter position bug
* Refresh environment data without relaunch

#### Overview of changes (v2.0):
* Now a standalone application, no need of .NET framework
* Reduced memory consumption
* Takes much less time in saving changes
