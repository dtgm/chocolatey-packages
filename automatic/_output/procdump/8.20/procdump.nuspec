    <summary>Command-line utility to capture process dumps</summary>
    <description>
ProcDump is a command-line utility whose primary purpose is monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps. 

#### Command line usage

__procdump__ [__-a__] [[__-c__|__-cl__ _CPU usage_] [__-u__] [__-s__ _seconds_]] [__-n__ _exceeds_] [__-e__ [1 [__-b__]] [__-f__ &lt;filter,...&gt;] [__-g__] [__-h__] [__-l__] [__-m__|__-ml__ _commit usage_] [__-ma__ | __-mp__] [__-o__] [__-p__|__-pl__ _counter threshold_] [__-r__] [__-t__] [__-d__ &lt;_callback DLL_&gt;] [__-64__] &lt;[__-w__] &lt;_process name_ | _service name_ | _PID_&gt; [_dump file_] | __-i__ &lt;dump file&gt; | __-u__ | __-x__ &lt;dump file&gt; &lt;image file&gt; [_arguments_] &gt;] [__-?__ [ __-e__]

__-a__
`     Avoid outage. Requires -r. If the trigger will cause the target to suspend for a prolonged time due to an exceeded concurrent dump limit, the trigger will be skipped`

__-b__
`     Treat debug breakpoints as exceptions (otherwise ignore them)`

__-c__
`     CPU threshold at which to create a dump of the process`

__-cl__
`     CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process`

__-d__
`     Invoke the minidump callback routine named MiniDumpCallbackRoutine of the specified DLL`

__-e__
`     Write a dump when the process encounters an unhandled exception. Include the 1 to create dump on first chance exceptions`

__-f__
`     Filter the first chance exceptions. Wildcards (*) are supported. To just display the names without dumping, use a blank ("") filter`

__-g__
`     Run as a native debugger in a managed process (no interop)`

__-h__
`     Write dump if process has a hung window (does not respond to window messages for at least 5 seconds)`

__-i__
`     Install ProcDump as the AeDebug postmortem debugger. Only -ma, -mp, -d and -r are supported as additional options`

__-l__
`     Display the debug logging of the process`

__-m__
`     Memory commit threshold in MB at which to create a dump`

__-ma__
`     Write a dump file with all process memory. The default dump format only includes thread and handle information`

__-ml__
`     Trigger when memory commit drops below specified MB value`

__-mp__
`     Write a dump file with thread and handle information, and all read/write process memory. To minimize dump size, memory areas larger than 512MB are searched for, and if found, the largest area is excluded. A memory area is the collection of same sized memory allocation areas. The removal of this (cache) memory reduces Exchange and SQL Server dumps by over 90%`

__-n__
`     Number of dumps to write before exiting`

__-o__
`     Overwrite an existing dump file`

__-p__
`     Trigger on the specified performance counter when the threshold is exceeded. Note: to specify a process counter when there are multiple instances of the process running, use the process ID with the following syntax: "\Process(&lt;name&gt;`_&lt;pid&gt;)\counter"`

__-pl__
`     Trigger when performance counter falls below the specified value`

__-r__
`     Dump using a clone. Concurrent limit is optional (default 1, max 5).  CAUTION: a high concurrency value may impact system performance`
      
  * Windows 7, 8 : Uses Reflection. OS doesn't support -e.      
  * Windows 8.1+ : Uses PSS. All trigger types are supported.      

__-s__
`     Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10)`

__-t__
`     Write a dump when the process terminates`

__-u__
`     Treat CPU usage relative to a single core (used with -c).  As the only option, Uninstalls ProcDump as the postmortem debugger`

__-w__
`     Wait for the specified process to launch if it's not running`

__-x__
`     Launch the specified image with optional arguments. If it is a Store Application or Package, ProcDump will start on the next activation (only)`

__-64__
`     By default ProcDump will capture a 32-bit dump of a 32-bit process when running on 64-bit Windows. This option overrides to create a 64-bit dump. Only use for WOW64 subsystem debugging`

__-?__
`     Use -? -e to see example command lines`
