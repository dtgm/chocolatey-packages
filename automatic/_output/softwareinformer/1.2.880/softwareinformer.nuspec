Software Informer is a programme, whose primary aim is to give you the up-to-date information about the software you actually use.
Whenever a more recent version of any programme becomes available, Software Informer notifies you and offers a link for downloading the update.
It also allows you to keep track of comments and questions on corresponding software.
Not only that, but also a whole software-related social network paired with our siClient program, where you will be able to: 
-Get notifications about important software updates
-Find a perfect program according to your needs
-Ask questions and get feedback from experienced users
-Share your opinions
-Meet people with similar interests
-And much more
