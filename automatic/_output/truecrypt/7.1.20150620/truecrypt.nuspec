Free open-source disk encryption software for Windows 7/Vista/XP, Mac OS X, and Linux.

### Abandonware
TrueCrypt is currently unmaintained (since 2014), which may have security implications. The [original website](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/) and forums have been taken offline. For more information, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#End_of_life_announcement) and the [community website](https://truecrypt.ch/) for plans on continuing development under a different name as required by the TrueCrypt license v3.0.

### Security audit
__Dec 2013:__ Prior to TrueCrypt developers abandoning the software, its security is brought to question and a public audit is called for and funded on a public [crowd-funding website](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-truecrypt-audit). 
__May 2014:__ The anonymous TrueCrypt developers announce no further development of TrueCrypt and recommend [Windows users](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/) to migrate to BitLocker, the closed source encryption available in certain versions of Microsoft Windows and [Mac OSX users](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/OtherPlatforms.html) migrate to OS' native encryption tools in Disk Utility.
__Apr 2015__: The [audit is completed](http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/) of TrueCrypt version 7.1a and published on https://opencryptoaudit.org/. The entirety of the final report is available as [PDF](https://opencryptoaudit.org/reports/TrueCrypt_Phase_II_NCC_OCAP_final.pdf). An excerpt from that report follows:

> The Open Crypto Audit Project engaged Cryptography Services (CS) to perform a scoped engagement
on portions of TrueCrypt's cryptographic implementations and use. This review was narrowly scoped
to specific aspects of the application, and was time-boxed to an engagement length that was deemed
sufficient to give adequate coverage of the components in place.
> [...]
> CS identified four (4) issues, and none led to a complete bypass of confidentiality
in common usage scenarios. The standard workflow of creating a volume and making use of it
was reviewed, and no significant flaws were found that would impact it.

### Version 7.2 (not installed)
Concurrent to the May 2014 announcement of abandoning the project and recommending users migrate to other software, version __7.2__ was released as a closed source installer of TrueCrypt intended for migrating encrypted TrueCrypt containers to other encryption software.

Due to the unexpected and suspicious announcement and lack of information detailing any changes or fixes made to the installer, it is generally advised __not__ to install version 7.2 for cautious users.

### Version 7.1a
Although open source version 7.1a was released 7 February 2012, no critical security issues are known and it has been found reliable and stable.

__This package installs and verifies via SHA1 checksum version 7.1a__

#### Package
Manually built and uploaded by [dtgm](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/dtgm) to address following issues:

* UNCHANGED: This package continues to install the last published open source release of TrueCrypt, version 7.1a, as made available by the community at https://truecrypt.ch/
* FIX (Security): The installer now verifies the executable with [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) before chocolatey proceeds with installation.  
`choco feature list` will indicate if chocolatey is verifying the checksum upon install. By default, it is Enabled.  
If `checksumFiles - [Disabled]` is returned, you may enable it with  
`choco feature enable -n=checksumFiles`
* FIX (Compatibility): The uninstaller now searches registry for install location rather than requiring default install location.
* FIX (Deprecated): Removed and cleaned deprecated parts from both install and uninstall scripts.
* FIX (Info): Additional information in nuspec: description, releaseNotes, tags, copyright
* FIX (Info): Corrected information in nuspec: summary, authors, icon
