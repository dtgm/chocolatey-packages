    <summary>Simple ad-hoc file transfer Windows FTP server</summary>
    <description>
Ftpdmin is a minimal Windows FTP server. FTP does not require an "install". It is intended to be run temporarily, on an as-needed basis basis to do file transfers between Windows computers without going thru the trouble of trying to configure windows file sharing or an FTP server. Also useful for Windows to Linux if the Linux computer doesn't happen to have an FTP server already set up and configured.

Ftpdmin is not intended as an internet FTP server, or even intended to be left running. Rather, Ftpdmin is started from the command line so that another computer can connect to it via FTP, typically over a LAN. When the file transfers are done, stop Ftpdmin. No 'installation' is necessary to use it.

Ftpdmin has no notion of security or even passwords. Rather, once it is running, everyone can connect to it. The only resemblance of security is the -g option (get only, disallows put), and the ability to specify a directory that ftpdmin shall consider the root directory.

#### Program
* Source code: [zip](http://www.sentex.net/%7Emwandel/ftpdmin/ftpdmin-src.zip) (build with Microsoft Visual C++)
* Known issues: Ftpdmin will mess up directory handling if you connect with more than one client at a time. Fixing this would require a fair bit of work, as ftpdmin relies on the OS's current directory as its own directory, but the current directory is not thread local. However, the way ftpdmin is meant to be used, this isn't really a problem.

#### Package
* Automatically built and uploaded by [dtgm](https://chocolatey.org/profiles/dtgm)
