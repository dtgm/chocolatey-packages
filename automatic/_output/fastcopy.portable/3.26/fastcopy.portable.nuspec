    <description>
FastCopy is the Fastest Copy/Delete Software on Windows. 

It supports UNICODE and over MAX_PATH (260 byte) file pathnames. 

It automatically selects different methods according to whether Source and DestDir are in the same or different HDD. Diff HDD Reading and writing are processed respectively in parallel by separate threads. 
Same HDD Reading is processed until the big buffer fills. When the big buffer filled, writing is started and processed in bulk.  

Because Reading/Writing are processed with no OS cache at all, other applications don't easily become slow. 

It can achieve Reading/Writing performance that is close to device limit. 

Include/Exclude Filter (UNIX Wildcard style) can be specified. 

It runs fast and does not hog resources, because MFC is not used. (Designed using Win32 API and C Runtime only) 

You can modify this software, because all source code has been opened to the public in the BSD license.
