#### New package name: __[krita](https://chocolatey.org/packages/krita)__

- - -

`krita-gemini` has been deprecated because it is no longer possible to install with chocolatey. Krita Gemini is exclusively available through Valve’s Steam [app store](http://store.steampowered.com/app/280680/).

Krita Gemini is a version of Krita that has both a traditional desktop user interface, as well as an interface optimized for tablets and touch interaction.

It exists only for backward compatibility to provide a transitional dummy package for existing users and scripts which may still use this package ID.

    <description>Krita's design emphasizes creating artwork from beginning to end as opposed to manipulating existing images. Therefore it has been influenced to an extent by software such as Corel Painter, but Krita supports a very different feature set than the most comparable applications. For example Krita developers included the ability to work with both bitmap and vector illustration on one hand, but deliberately choose to avoid high end photography plugins in favor of features more specific to painting and drawing.</description>
