    <description>
Gpg4win-light (GNU Privacy Guard for Windows) is a suite of programs for file encryption and digital signatures, excluding the documentation and Kleopatra, the GUI certificate manager and encryption/signature tool.

Gpg4win enables users to securely transport emails and files with the help of encryption and digital signatures. Encryption protects the contents against an unwanted party reading it. Digital signatures allow authors of files to sign them prior to distribution so a user may verify the file has not been tampered with and comes from a specific sender.

Gpg4win supports both relevant cryptography standards, [OpenPGP](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880.txt) and Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) X.509 certificates, and is the official GnuPG distribution for Windows. 

It is maintained by the developers of GnuPG. Gpg4win and the software included with Gpg4win are Free Software (Open Source; among other things free of charge for all commercial and non-commercial purposes).

__[gpg4win-vanilla](https://chocolatey.org/packages/gpg4win-vanilla)__ includes:

* [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#general) -- The backend (command-line interface); this is the actual encryption and digital signature tool used by the other software in the suite.

__gpg4win-light__ (this package) includes all the above, and:

* GNU Privacy Assistant ([GPA](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpa/index.html)) -- An alternative program for managing OpenPGP and X.509 (S/MIME) certificates.

* GPG Explorer eXtension ([GpgEX](http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=gpgex.git;a=summary)) -- A plugin for Microsoft Windows File Explorer to sign and encrypt messages using the context menu.

__[gpg4win](https://chocolatey.org/packages/gpg4win)__ includes all the above, and:

* [Kleopatra](https://www.kde.org/applications/utilities/kleopatra/) -- The central certiﬁcate administration of Gpg4win, which ensures uniform user navigation for all cryptographic operations.
