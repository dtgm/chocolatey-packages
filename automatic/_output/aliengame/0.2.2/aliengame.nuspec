    <summary>Learn about solving complex problems by playing a game</summary>
    <description>
Play the game to help us figure out what WE should be thinking about when trying to understand how people solve complex problems.

“When you play a game — if you learn to be good at it — you find what it is you should have been thinking about” (John Conway).
