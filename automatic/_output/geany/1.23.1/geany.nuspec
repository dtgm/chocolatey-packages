Geany is a small and lightweight Integrated Development Environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages.
Another goal was to be as independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.
Some basic features of Geany:
* Syntax highlighting
* Code folding
* Symbol name auto-completion
* Construct completion/snippets
* Auto-closing of XML and HTML tags
* Call tips
* Many supported filetypes including C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal 
# Symbol lists
# Code navigation
# Build system to compile and execute your code
# Simple project management
# Plugin interface
