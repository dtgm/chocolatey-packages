### Known issues
* __Old Nirsoft utilities:__ The scripts of NirLauncher automatically take only utilities that have been updated since 01/10/2007. This means that some of the very old utilities of NirSoft are not included in this package. This restriction was added in order to avoid from including obsolete utilities that are not fully portable and may write their settings to the Registry.
* __False Positives:__ Many Antivirus programs display false alerts, saying that the password-recovery utilities of NirSoft are infected with Trojan/Virus/Malware; [more info](http://blog.nirsoft.net/2009/05/17/antivirus-companies-cause-a-big-headache-to-small-developers/).
* __Reporting false alerts:__ If your Antivirus software shows a false alert, you can use the following article that explains how to send a report about a false positive issue to your Antivirus company: [How to Report False Positives to Antivirus Vendors](http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-report-malware-or-false-positives-multiple-antivirus-vendors.htm)
