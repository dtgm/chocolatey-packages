    <description>
Scilab is free and open source software for numerical computation providing a powerful computing environment for engineering and scientific applications. 

Scilab includes hundreds of mathematical functions. It has a high level programming language allowing access to advanced data structures, 2-D and 3-D graphical functions.

#### [Features](https://www.scilab.org/scilab/features/)

* Maths and Simulation for usual engineering and science applications including mathematical operations and data analysis.
* 2-D and 3-D Visualization graphics functions to visualize, annotate and export data and many ways to create and customize various types of plots and charts. 
* Optimization algorithms to solve constrained and unconstrained continuous and discrete optimization problems.
* Statistics tools to perform data analysis and modeling.
* Control System Design and Analyse standard algorithms and tools for control system study.
* Signal Processing to visualize, analyze and filter signals in time and frequency domains. 
* Application Development to increase Scilab native functionalities and manage data exchanges with external tools.
* Xcos - Hybrid dynamic systems modeler and simulator for modeling mechanical systems, hydraulic circuits, control systems...

#### Scilab as a platform

Thanks to its ability to interconnect with [third-party technologies](https://www.scilab.org/scilab/interoperability/calculation_engine) and [applications](https://www.scilab.org/scilab/interoperability/connection_applications), Scilab can also act as a unique platform to bring together codes written in [different programming languages](https://www.scilab.org/scilab/interoperability/connection_languages) in a single, unified language, thus facilitating their distribution, their back-up and use.
