    <summary>Unpacker for installations made by Inno Setup</summary>   
    <description>
Inno Setup is a popular program for making software installations. Unfortunately, there is no official unpacker - the only method of getting the files out of the self-extracting executable is to run it. One piece of software that addresses this issue is Sergei Wanin's InstallExplorer, a plug-in for the FAR Manager that unpacks several types of installations, including Inno Setup (IS). But since it is not updated in a timely fashion, and so does not support the latest IS most of the time, this program was born. 

The advantages over InstallExplorer are:

* Innounp is open source and based on IS source. Therefore, it is more likely to support future IS versions.
* It recovers portions of the installation script (.iss file), including the registry changes and the compiled Innerfuse/RemObjects Pascal Script, if available.
