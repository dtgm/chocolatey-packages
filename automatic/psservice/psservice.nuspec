PsService is a service viewer and controller for Windows. Like the SC utility that's included in the Windows NT and Windows 2000 Resource Kits, PsService displays the status, configuration, and dependencies of a service, and allows you to start, stop, pause, resume and restart them. Unlike the SC utility, PsService enables you to logon to a remote system using a different account, for cases when the account from which you run it doesn't have required permissions on the remote system. PsService includes a unique service-search capability, which identifies active instances of a service on your network. You would use the search feature if you wanted to locate systems running DHCP servers, for instance.

#### Command line usage

The default behavior of _PsService_ is to display the configured services (both running and stopped) on the local system. Entering a command on the command-line invokes a particular feature, and some commands accept options. Typing a command followed by "- " displays information on the syntax for the command.

__psservice__ [\\\\computer [__-u__ username] [__-p__ password]] &lt;_command_&gt; &lt;_options_&gt;

__query__
`     Displays the status of a service.`

__config__
`     Displays the configuration of a service.`

__setconfig__
`     Sets the start type (disabled, auto, demand) of a service.`

__start__
`     Starts a service.`

__stop__
`     Stops a service.`

__restart__
`     Stops and then restarts a service.`

__pause__
`     Pauses a service`

__cont__
`     Resumes a paused service.`

__depend__
`     Lists the services dependent on the one specified.`

__security__
`     Dumps the service's security descriptor.`

__find__
`     Searches the network for the specified service.`

__\\\\computer__
`     Targets the NT/Win2K system specified. Include the -u switch with a username and password to login to the remote system if your security credentials do not permit you to obtain performance counter information from the remote system. If you specify the -u option, but not a password with the -p option, _PsService_ will prompt you to enter the password and will not echo it to the screen.`
