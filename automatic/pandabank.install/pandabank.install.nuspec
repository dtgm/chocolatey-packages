Pandabank manages and provides secure storage of your Pandacoins while earning 2.5% annual interest.  Pandacoin is different from Bitcoin or Litecoin in that coins can be earned without expensive mining equipment.  New pandacoins are generated from existing pandacoins at a rate of 2.5% per annum.  This occurs while PandaBank is running and requires negligible system resources.

Pandacoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Pandacoin is an open source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities.
