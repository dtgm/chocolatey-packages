# files and reference files used to solve issues

This subdirectory includes non-important files and may be safely omitted when cloning this repo.

Many of the files that exist here are for convenience and should probably not exist at all or in a different form since:

* the code present here should be present in other locations of this repository
* the files could (should?) be attached directly to GitHub issues rather than referencing these files in commits

For now I will include these files here.

* ketarin XML files

Please note I will most likely modify my workflow so this directory will not be needed as it currently exists, if at all.
